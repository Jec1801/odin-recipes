<h3>Description</h3>
 <p>A delicious runny yolk egg cooked in the center of a piece of toast and eaten with a fork is a great way to enjoy an egg in a slightly different way. My kids feel fancy when eating these. </p>

 <h3>Ingredients</h3>
 <ul> 
  <li>1Â½ teaspoons bacon grease </li>
  <li>1 slice bread </li>
  <li> 1 egg </li>
  <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste </li>
 </ul>

<h3>Steps</h3>
 <ol>
  <li>Melt the bacon grease in a non-stick pan over low heat.</li>
  <li>Cut a 1 1/2 to 2-inch hole from the center of the bread slice; lay in the hot skillet. When the side facing down is lightly toasted, about 2 minutes, flip and crack the egg into the hole; season with salt and pepper. Continue to cook until the egg is cooked and mostly firm. Flip again and cook 1 minute more to assure doneness on both sides. Serve immediately.</li>
 </ol>
